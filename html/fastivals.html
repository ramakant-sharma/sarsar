    <h1>Holi</h1>
        <p>Holi is the widely celebrating festival of the year just like Diwali by the Hindus. Every year it falls in the month of Falgun (or March) which indicates the beginning of the spring season too. There is a great history and significance of celebrating this holi festival every year. Long years ago, there was a Holika, a devil sister of devil Hiranyakashyap who tried to burn Prahlad (son of her brother) in the big fire by taking him in her lap. Prahlad was a true devotee of God who was saved from fire by the God however Holika was burnt and changed to ashes. From then, Hindu people celebrate the victory of goodness over the devil power every year as a festival of holi.</p>

        <p>It is believed that on this day, Lord Rama returned to his hometown Ayodhya after staying in exile for fourteen long years. He was accompanied by his brother Lakshman and wife Sita. Sita was abducted by the demon, Ravana. She was kept as a hostage in his kingdom until Lord Rama defeated him and brought her back. As Lord Rama, Lakshman and Sita returned to Ayodhya, the people were thrilled and excited.
